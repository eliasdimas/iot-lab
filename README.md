- Project : Data collection from sensor network (swarm) - Fire Alarm 

## About this project

Swarm is a compilation of different types of sensors, combined and coordinated to collect and distribute information.
We chose a Fire Alarm system to demonstrate the use and importance of sensor networks(swarms) in our daily lives.
The swarm of our choice is capable of detecting the temperature and the humidity level of the room it is placed in, detect smoke and fire and transmite a sound alarm in case of blaze.
